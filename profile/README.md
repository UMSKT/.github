# Universal MS Key Toolkit
This readme shows the "important stuff", which is the stuff you're probably looking for.

* Generating keys or confirmation IDs? You'll need [UMSKT](https://github.com/UMSKT/UMSKT).
* Programmatically managing keys or confirmation IDs? You'll need [xpmgr](https://github.com/UMSKT/xpmgr).
* Interested in how activation works? Visit the [writeup repository](https://github.com/UMSKT/writeups).
* Need the right parameters to make keys? Go to the [PIDDatabase Viewer](https://umskt.github.io/PIDDatabase-viewer) (or see it's [source code](https://github.com/UMSKT/PIDDatabase-viewer)).

All other repositories are more or less for development purposes, rather than a usable product.
