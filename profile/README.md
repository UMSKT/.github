# Universal MS Key Toolkit
This readme shows the "important stuff", which is the stuff you're probably looking for.

* Generating keys or confirmation IDs? You'll need [UMSKT](https://github.com/UMSKT/UMSKT).
* Programmatically managing keys or confirmation IDs? You'll need [xpmgr](https://github.com/UMSKT/xpmgr).
* Interested in how activation works? Visit the [writeup repository](https://github.com/UMSKT/writeups).

All other repositories are more or less for development purposes, rather than a usable product.
